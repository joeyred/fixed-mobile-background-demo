# Fixed Background on Mobile Browser with HTML & CSS only.

Ever try to set a background image to `fixed` on mobile? It doesn't end well. This is a work around with pure HTML and CSS to get a fixed background that works on mobile browsers.

This is a demo set up as a "proof of concept" after [the CodePen](https://codepen.io/joeyred/pen/pEagLQ) I made for this didn't display correctly on mobile. Something to do with how CodePen renders their code on mobile. So this is here to show that this does indeed work.
